Basic Truth Table

First Mini Project

Referenced from my Discrete Mathematics Lesson "Simple Logical Connectives"

!NOTE

This program only accepts three characters namely;

Any character which will symbolizes (p)
Any of the following logical connective
Negation (¬)
Conjunction (^)
Exclusive Or (⊻)
Disjunction (v)
Implication (→)
Biconditional (↔)
Any character which will symbolize (q)
For the mean time it will only process simple propositions ONLY

It should be written in this format (firstChar_connective_lastChar)

Where: firstChar & lastChar = any alphabet connective = (^) | (⊻) | (v) | (→) | (↔) (_) = spaces

(¬) are merged with firstChar or lastChar to denote negation

Example : 

p ^ q OR 
a v ¬b OR
¬x → y 
OR ¬i ↔ ¬j

!END OF NOTE

COMPOUND LOGICAL TABLE GENERATOR IS ON THE WORKS.
