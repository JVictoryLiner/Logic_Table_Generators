Basic Truth Table

First Mini Project

Referenced from my Discrete Mathematics Lesson "Simple Logical Connectives"

!NOTE

This program only accepts three characters namely;

1. Any character which will symbolizes (p)
2. Any of the following logical connective;
    Negation (¬)
    Conjunction (^)
    Exclusive Or (⊻)
    Disjunction (v)
    Implication (→)
    Biconditional (↔)
    
3. Any character which will symbolize (q)

It should be written in this format (firstChar_connective_lastChar)
(¬) are merged with firstChar or lastChar to denote negation

Where: 
  1. firstChar & lastChar = any alphabet 
  2. connective = (^) | (⊻) | (v) | (→) | (↔) 
  3. (_) = spaces

Example : 
    1. p ^ q  
    2. a v ¬b 
    3. ¬x → y 
    4. ¬i ↔ ¬j

For the mean time it will only process simple propositions ONLY

COMPOUND LOGICAL TABLE GENERATOR IS ON THE WORKS.
